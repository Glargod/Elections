Unlike smart guns that rely on biometrics or RFID, COZAL focuses on muzzle orientation, making it ideal for dynamic scenarios like hunting, range shooting, and law enforcement training. The system is lightweight, reliable, and shared freely with the industry to become a new safety standard.</p> </div> <div class="section" id="features"> <h2>Key Features</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Angular Lockout:</strong> Uses orientation sensors to engage the safety if the muzzle exceeds preset limits (e.g., ±90° yaw, ±10° pitch for hunters; ±5° yaw/pitch for range users), ensuring the rifle only fires in safe directions.</li> <li><strong>User Configurations:</strong> Offers modes for short/long-range hunting, bird hunting, range shooting, and a law/military bypass for professional use.</li> <li><strong>Simple Design:</strong> Incorporates minimal components—sensors, a microcontroller, an actuator, a single button, and a small battery—adding negligible weight while prioritizing reliability.</li> <li><strong>User-Friendly:</strong> Defaults to "on" for safety, with a quick reset function, a single LED for feedback (optional), and power-efficient firmware.</li> <li><strong>Industry Collaboration:</strong> Shared freely with the industry, aiming to become a credited standard for rifle safety.</li> </ul> </div> <div class="section" id="technical-specs"> <h2>Technical Specifications for Retrofitting a Simple Rifle</h2> <p>The COZAL System is designed to be retrofitted onto a simple bolt-action or semi-automatic rifle with minimal modification. Below are the full technical specs and retrofitting instructions:</p> <h3>Components</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Orientation Sensors:</strong> MEMS-based IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) with 6-axis capability (3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope); accuracy ±0.5°; sampling rate 100 Hz.</li> <li><strong>Microcontroller:</strong> Low-power 32-bit MCU (e.g., STM32L0 series); 64 KB flash, 8 KB RAM; supports I2C/SPI for sensor communication.</li> <li><strong>Actuator:</strong> Compact solenoid actuator (5V, 0.5A) to engage/disengage the safety mechanism; response time <50 ms.</li> <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> 3.7V, 300 mAh lithium-ion battery; rechargeable via micro-USB; runtime ~100 hours on a single charge.</li> <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Single tactile button for mode selection/reset; optional single LED (green/red) for status feedback (on/off, zone breach).</li> <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Polycarbonate enclosure (IP65-rated for dust/water resistance); dimensions 50 mm x 30 mm x 15 mm; weight ~50 g (including battery).</li> <li><strong>Mounting Hardware:</strong> Two M3 screws and a universal mounting bracket compatible with standard rifle accessory rails (e.g., Picatinny).</li> </ul> <h3>Retrofitting Instructions</h3> <ol> <li><strong>Mounting the Unit:</strong> Attach the COZAL housing to the rifle’s accessory rail (preferably near the trigger guard for balance) using the mounting bracket and M3 screws. Ensure the IMU’s orientation aligns with the barrel (calibration required post-installation).</li> <li><strong>Safety Mechanism Integration:</strong> Modify the rifle’s existing safety mechanism to interface with the solenoid actuator. For a simple bolt-action rifle, this involves linking the actuator to the safety lever via a small push/pull rod (custom length based on rifle model, typically 20–30 mm). The actuator should block the safety lever in the “safe” position when activated.</li> <li><strong>Wiring and Power:</strong> Route the actuator and sensor wires through the housing, securing them with adhesive clips to avoid interference with moving parts. Connect the battery and charge it fully via the micro-USB port.</li> <li><strong>Calibration:</strong> Power on the system (defaults to “on”). Hold the rifle in a neutral firing position and press the button for 5 seconds to calibrate the IMU’s zero point. The LED (if installed) will flash green to confirm.</li> <li><strong>Mode Selection:</strong> Short-press the button to cycle through modes (e.g., hunting: ±90° yaw, ±10° pitch; range: ±5° yaw/pitch). A double-flash of the LED indicates mode change.</li> <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Test the system by moving the muzzle outside the defined zone— the actuator should engage the safety within 50 ms, preventing firing. Reset by returning the muzzle to the safe zone and pressing the button (quick reset).</li> </ul> <h3>Optional Enhancements</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Ruggedization:</strong> Use military-grade IMU and enclosure (MIL-STD-810G) for extreme conditions.</li> <li><strong>Firmware Optimization:</strong> Implement sleep mode to extend battery life to ~150 hours.</li> <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Add a buzzer for audible alerts on zone breach (optional, 80 dB, 3V).</li> </ul> <h3>Compatibility Notes</h3> <p>The COZAL System is designed for rifles with a manual safety mechanism that can be mechanically interfaced with the actuator. For rifles without a manual safety (e.g., some striker-fired designs), additional modification to the firing mechanism (e.g., a firing pin block) may be required. Consult a gunsmith for complex integrations.</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h2>Why COZAL Matters</h2> <p>With approximately 430 unintentional firearm deaths annually in the U.S., and many occurring during hunting or handling, the need for innovative safety solutions is clear. COZAL addresses these risks by ensuring rifles only fire in safe directions, making it a practical solution for hunters, range shooters, law enforcement, and families. Its lightweight design and minimal user input make it accessible for all shooters, without sacrificing reliability.</p> </div> <div class="cta" id="collaborate"> <h2>Let’s Make Shooting Safer Together!</h2> <p>The COZAL System is shared freely with the industry to become a new safety standard.
