        <!-- Previous sections unchanged: Introduction through Advocacy -->

        <h2 id="qanda">Q&A for Reform Groups, Activists, and Party Members</h2>
        <h3>1. How does the Voter Readiness Certificate avoid voter suppression?</h3>
        <p>The Voter Readiness Certificate ensures informed participation without elitism. It’s a free, middle-school-level test (e.g., “What does the Prime Minister do?”) available in multiple languages, with audio, braille, and unlimited retakes. Waivers and proxy assistance cater to accessibility needs, ensuring no voter is excluded. Pilots will track participation to confirm inclusivity, addressing concerns about marginalized groups.</p>

        <h3>2. Won’t the Dynamic PolicyMatch’s 50-100 questions overwhelm voters?</h3>
        <p>Not at all. The <a href="#policymatch">flowchart</a> illustrates this: voters choose Core Mode (10-15 questions) for accessibility or Full Policy Mode (50-100) for depth. Questions are themed (e.g., economy, healthcare) and spread over a week, with progress saved. Mobile polling stations and simplified versions (5 questions) ensure inclusivity, balancing depth with ease.</p>

        <h3>3. How do you ensure PolicyMatch questions aren’t biased?</h3>
        <p>An independent commission verifies the question bank (50-100 questions covering mandates and counterpoints) for fairness. PlatformEval AI provides objective summaries (e.g., “Dental care: $2.88B/year, rural access strain”), balancing perspectives. The process is transparent, with public reports and post-vote explanations (e.g., “You voted PPC due to tax cut priority”).</p>

        <h3>4. Can we trust the symbolic AI votes to be unbiased?</h3>
        <p>Yes. The Universal Voter Ethics Charter mandates that AIs use open-source algorithms, audited by an independent commission, with no access to voter data. Votes are symbolic, revealed post-election, and accompanied by explanations (e.g., “AI-1 voted PPC for $50B savings”), sparking discussion without influencing outcomes.</p>

        <h3>5. How does blockchain transparency prevent fraud without intimidating voters?</h3>
        <p>Blockchain tallying, backed by paper ballots, ensures indisputable results while live-streamed counts and audits build trust. The Unified Digital Identity (UDI) uses zero-knowledge proofs for privacy, with low-tech options (physical cards, paper ballots) for tech-averse voters. Simplified messaging (e.g., “Like a secure library card”) eases adoption.</p>

        <h3>6. Who funds this system, and is it feasible for small jurisdictions?</h3>
        <p>Public-private partnerships (e.g., tech firms, foundations) can fund pilots, with long-term savings from fraud prevention. Pilots in local elections (e.g., Austin, Toronto) test scalability, using mobile polling stations and low-tech options to adapt to smaller jurisdictions, ensuring feasibility.</p>

        <h3>7. How does TrustVote 3000 appeal to both activists and party leaders?</h3>
        <p>Activists value its focus on voter empowerment, policy-driven outcomes, and transparency, addressing distrust in elections. Party leaders benefit from votes aligning with platforms, reducing emotional manipulation, while the flowchart shows a clear, fair process. Bipartisan appeal—transparency for conservatives, education for progressives—ensures broad support.</p>
